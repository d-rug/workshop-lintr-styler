This mini-workshop aims to convince you that you should write code with a style in mind, and to show you what tools are available to help with that.

## R style guides
There are numerous R style guides, but only two are widely used: [the `tidyverse` style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html), and [the Google R style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html). In fact, the Google style guide is just the `tidyverse` guide with a few small adjustments. You don't have to adopt either style completely - you don't have to do *anything* - but I recommend adopting `tidyverse` style except in cases where you have a specific reason not to (e.g., I like to use `=` for assignment because it is more intuitive for folks coming from Python or most other programming languages).
