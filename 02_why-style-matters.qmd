title: "Why care about code style?"

Everyone has a coding style, whether or not they consciously consider it. So if we already have a style without working for it, why should we bother to read and adopt anything but our intuitive, natural code style?

## Technical debt
Some of us will recall discussing a [series of papers in the R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/issues/2021-2/) about the need for software engineering best practices in R programming. [The lead paper in the series](https://journal.r-project.org/articles/RJ-2021-108/) cited technical debt as the cost of eschewing best practices in R code, and defined technical debt like this:

> Code quality is often related to technical debt. Technical Debt (TD) is a metaphor used to reflect the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution in the present, instead of using a better approach that would take longer (Samarthyam et al., 2017).
